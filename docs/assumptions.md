## Assumptions:  
### Loan Customer
#### Loan Application, Loans, and Payments
- The customer first signs up for a Loan Application
- Then if It's approved by the Bank Staff then a Loan record is automatically created in the database with the appropriate fields
- Payments are done through a payment endpoint where the customer just calls it to add a payment  

### Bank 
The Bank `total_funds` is stored in the database and is
  - incremented when:
    - Approval of **Loan Fund Application**
    - Customer **Payment** occurs
  - decremented when:
    - Approval of **Loan Application**

The system keeps track of this value through all transactions, making sure that the is always sufficient amount of funds in place


### Bank Staff
The Bank Staff can view all applications from either customers or loan providers. A staff member can then choose to approve
or deny any of the applications whether that be a **Loan Fund Application** or **Loan Application**

Approval of a **Loan Application** is done after the system checking if there are sufficient funds in the bank.
After that, a **Loan** record is created in the database with the specified `interest_rate` and `duration`. 

Payments of this loan should be calculated as follows:
    
> payment = ((loan_amount * interest_rate) + loan_amount) / duration_in_months
